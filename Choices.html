<p>In modern digital society, threats of cybercrime have reach everybody and poses significant challenges to individuals, community or government. As form of cybercrimes and cyberattacks complexity continue to evolve and improve, we need to develop new defending methods to minimize the impact and to protect the integrity and confidentiality of our information. (Chen L, 2016) 

  The choice available to us will be improvement of threat detection access control or technology. This will include combinations of detection methods like the combination of penetration test and vulnerability scanning. While penetration test to simulate attacking scenarios to discover potential security vulnerabilities of the system.(Futong Xu , 2022), vulnerability assessment/scanning includes analysis of the system in either static and dynamic aspect to discover potential vulnerabilities, then need to be categorized and examine. Through the combination of those 2 technology and techniques, organizations or government can distinguish how urgent of the vulnerabilities within the system, and therefore fix the it to minimize the chance of getting attack.  
  
<p>Options for using cutting-edge cybersecurity measures there are many decisions to be made while using  complex cybersecurity measures, and each one has a big impact on the overall safety of the company. While there are many advantages to integrating machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligent (AI) into cybersecurity structures, there are also concerns that must be carefully considered in order to maximise efficacy and minimise potential hazards. Recent studies show that selecting the appropriate ML and AI solutions based on cybersecurity requirements is crucial.  Sommer and Paxson (2010), for example, stress how crucial it is for machine learning algorithms for identifying network intrusions to be contextually and environmentally adaptive. They contend that although machine learnig (ML) methods can greatly improve alerting abilities, their efficacy mostly rely on regular reinforcement learning with pertinent data. According to this Saxe and Berlin (2015) show that deep learning models, when educated on a variety of samples that contain a wide range of risk behaviors, can identify emerging malware variants with greater accuracy than traditional approaches.   

  Technological developments in encryption are essential for safeguarding private information from illegal access. Robust encryption techniques guarantee that, even in the event of data interception, it will stay unintelligible without the proper decryption key (Zhou et al., 2020). To protect interactions, money transfers and private data latest enryption techniques  such the advanced encryption standard (AES) and RSA are widely used (Stallings, 2018). Ensuring the future of digital security requires the creation and application of quantum-resistant algorithims for encryptions in response to the increasing sophistication of cyber threats cyber-attacks (Chen et al., 2016).
