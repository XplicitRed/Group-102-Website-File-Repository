<p> As technology and digital systems are more popularized causing interconnection brought unprecedented advantages between individuals and communities.  But it also generates new vulnerabilities and loopholes for computer programs, exposing members in society to potential cyber-threats.  

<p> Firstly, Cybercrimes can weaken the competitiveness of institutions and lead to long-term economic loss of company or society through various aspects such as disruption of service, data breach and direct financial lost due to theft and fraud.  
For example, a key issue of cyberattack is privacy leakage, this is done by online frauds, which is camouflaged in various forms. By impersonating trustworthy or legitimate organization to trigger individuals to input their sensitive information, further-more, to trigger individuals to downloaded software through social engineering skills, and allow software itself to enter computer system and take advantage of system vulnerabilities to gain access to computer system and to monitor user's activities, or steal importance information, As a result, this information can be used for trading or selling to others who are interested in, or to threaten company or individuals to pay for ransom payments. This not only caused direct financial lost but might causes victims to be exposed to potential legal actions and hefty fines.  According to research "7.4% of the businesses report paying fines or compensations up to €9999. In 1.2% of these incidents, the payments range between €10,000 and €49,999.”. (Paoli.L,2018) 
  
   
<p> Beyond financial losses, cyber-attacks can have intense psychological effects on people and communities, Studies have shown that the psychological impact of cyber threats can be comparable to traditional forms of terrorism. As they still in fear and uncertainty in affected populations (Rhoad, 2023). Moreover, members of certain communities will be threatened or hated by extreme organization making them feel isolated and limiting victims from accessing necessary supports for recovery. (Rhoads J,2023) Which will lead to an increase of anxiety and fear of an individual, allowing individuals to develop negative feelings like stress, anxiety, a sense of insecurity and vulnerability .   The psychological toll is particularly significant in the case of identity theft and online harassment. Victims of identity theft may face long term challenges in restoring their financial standing in personal security. Similarly, online harassment or other online crime activities can lead to severe mental instability, depression and suicidal tendencies for younger individuals. 
  More importantly, cybercrime can destroy critical infrastructure and fail the operation and service of society.  

<p> 

  Cyber-attacks pose significant threats to critical infrastructure sectors, such as healthcare service and medical system operation.  Due to low level of cybersecurity of network system, organizations experience an increase of ransomware attacks or other cyber activities conducted by cybercriminals to steal or gain access to computer and network system.  
  
   This will cause critical files and data in the operating system to be encrypted or cause system shutdown. As a result, medical stuff and patients will experience delays in patient care because of missing information for diagnosis, treatments and medical record, resulting in possible death.  Similarly, service and operation for society will be affected, besides direct impacts on individuals, the disruption of health service may overload the medical facilities and causing more pressure on medical stuff and causing unfair treatments for patients in emergency and causing increase level of distrust of public to healthcare organizations.
